# Popcount
Ever had an argument with someone over which movie/tv-series is better than the other? Well, not anymore. Popcount compares two movies or tv-series based on their awards, box office collection, Metascore, imdb rating and at last, imdb votes. Written in HTML, CSS (Bulma) and Vanilla JS. Movie data fetched from OMDB API.
